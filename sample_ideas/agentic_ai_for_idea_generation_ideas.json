            "Dynamic Prompt Adaptation": {
                "Problem": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherence over extended interactions or creative tasks, leading to thematic inconsistencies and reduced reader engagement.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current methods often use fixed prompts or few-shot examples, which may not adapt to the evolving context of a conversation or creative narrative. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought prompting are utilized, but they do not inherently address continuity and adaptability across interactions.",
                "Motivation": "Human creative writing often involves iterative dialogue and adaptation to the flow of discussion. The style and context of interactions can shift dynamically based on prior exchanges. Dynamic adaptation mirrors how authors and conversationalists adjust based on audience feedback and shifting themes.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Dynamic Prompt Adaptation, involving three phases: (1) Contextual Analysis - Analyze previous outputs and user prompts to extract key themes and tonal shifts, applying a prompting structure like 'Reflect on the previous topic of [theme] and build on it.' (2) Adaptive Prompt Generation - Using insights from the analysis, generate updated prompts that introduce new elements or clarify past responses, e.g., 'Continuing from your last thought on [theme], can you expand on how this might be represented in [new context]?' (3) Iterative Context Update - As the dialogue progresses, generate a synthesis of all prior interactions to maintain thematic coherence, prompting with 'Summarize the key points discussed so far to keep track of our narrative.'",
                "Experiment Plan": "Test against static prompting strategies by evaluating engagement scores, coherence assessments, and user satisfaction in storytelling scenarios using standard text generation metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE. Incorporate user feedback on naturalness and adaptability during the interaction. Datasets could include the 'Story Cloze Test' dataset and user-generated dialogue interactions scraped from platforms like Reddit to assess conversational engagement."
            },
            "Contextual Layered Prompting": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often fail to incorporate multi-faceted contextual information, leading to outputs that lack depth and nuance in complex scenarios such as legal reasoning or medical diagnosis.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing methods typically focus on providing a single-layer prompt or a fixed set of questions, like classical Chain-of-Thought methods or standard few-shot prompting, but they do not effectively leverage layered contextual insights.",
                "Motivation": "In complex fields, decisions are often multi-dimensional and require synthesizing different layers of information (e.g., relevant laws, precedents, ethical guidelines in law or symptoms, underlying health conditions in medicine). Prompting that emphasizes multiple layers of context can lead to richer outputs.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Contextual Layered Prompting (CLP), which prompts that sequentially build layers of context. The process involves: (1) Primary Context Identification - The model generates prompts identifying primary themes, such as 'What are the key legal issues surrounding the case of Smith v. Jones?' (2) Secondary Context Refinement - Based on the primary output, prompts identify relevant complications or nuances, e.g., 'What are the historical precedents influencing Smith v. Jones?' (3) Tertiary Context Analysis - Finally, the model synthesizes insights with prompts like 'Combining these elements, what will be the impact on future legal decisions in related cases?'",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate CLP against standard single-layer prompts on datasets specific to complex decision-making scenarios, like the 'Legal Text Corpus' (5000 annotated cases) and 'MIMIC-III' clinical database (dataset of medical records). Measure output depth using qualitative criteria such as clarity, relevance, and insightfulness from domain experts, alongside quantitative accuracy metrics like F1 scores on legal terminology and medical accuracy."
            },
            "Emotion-Adaptive Prompting": {
                "Problem": "Current LLMs often lack the ability to adapt outputs based on the emotional tone or sentiment that is appropriate for specific contexts, which can lead to mismatched responses in emotionally-charged scenarios.",
                "Existing Methods": "Most methodologies rely on content-based prompts without incorporating emotional context, utilizing techniques like sentiment-based classification to modify outputs post-generation, which isn't always effective.",
                "Motivation": "Research in psychology indicates that emotional intelligence, which includes adapting to others' emotions, plays a crucial role in effective communication. By integrating emotional cues into the prompting process, LLMs can generate responses more aligned with user sentiment.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Emotion-Adaptive Prompting, integrating an emotion recognition system into the prompting lifecycle. The process consists of: (1) Emotion Detection - Analyze previous dialogue to identify emotional tones, prompting with questions like 'What emotion is the user displaying based on previous exchanges?' (2) Emotion-Based Prompt Adjustment - Adjust prompts for the detected emotions, e.g., for sadness, prompt with 'Given the user\u2019s concern about [topic], how might we provide support?' (3) Response Generation - Generate culturally sensitive responses that naturally incorporate empathetic language tailored to the detected emotions.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Instead of human evaluations, utilize automated sentiment analysis tools like VADER and engagement metrics from platforms such as Chatbot.com to assess emotional appropriateness in generated outputs. Compare Emotion-Adaptive Prompting against standard prompting in scenarios where emotional context significantly impacts interactions (like customer service chats or therapeutic responses). Measure the effectiveness by analyzing sentiment trajectory over the interaction and user engagement scores."
            },
            "Chronological Prompt Structuring": {
                "Problem": "Long-form content generation and planning tasks often result in disorganized output, particularly when complex narratives or processes need to adhere to a coherent chronological sequence.",
                "Existing Methods": "Previous approaches utilize linear or recursive prompting strategies like steps defined through Chain-of-Thought but often fail to manage the overarching structure effectively in time-sensitive contexts.",
                "Motivation": "Human writers frequently organize thoughts and narratives logically using chronological structuring. We can leverage this approach in LLMs by guiding them to think about outputs in terms of a timeline or stages of progression.",
                "Proposed Method": "Chronological Prompt Structuring involves a prompting strategy that guides LLMs to consider temporal relationships explicitly. This includes: (1) Temporal Contextualization - Prompt the model to break down inputs into time-based segments, e.g., 'Outline key events that occurred during the 2020 pandemic from March to May 2020.' (2) Sequential Development - Each segment is prompted using: 'Expand on the implications of the event on the public health response during that time.' (3) Final Coherence Check - Following all segments, prompt for synthesis, e.g., 'Compile these timelines into a coherent summary of the pandemic's evolution over these months.'",
                "Experiment Plan": "Assess effectiveness in organizing generated content through structured tasks, benchmarking against unstructured input methods. Use datasets such as 'Eurisko' for narrative structure analysis and 'Project Gutenberg' historical texts to evaluate outputs for coherence and sequential integrity. Human evaluators will provide qualitative assessments for narrative clarity, while quantitative measures like BLEU scores will gauge narrative consistency across segments."
            },
            "Interdisciplinary Insight Prompting": {
                "Problem": "LLMs typically operate well within domain-specific knowledge but often struggle to make connections across disciplines, leading to ideas that lack interdisciplinary relevance or innovation.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing prompting techniques rely on domain-specific datasets, often lacking versatility, such as few-shot learning or direct topical prompts, which fail to stimulate holistic connections between domains.",
                "Motivation": "Real-world innovation often occurs at the intersection of multiple disciplines, drawing on diverse knowledge bases. By prompting LLMs to consider interdisciplinary connections, we can enhance their creative ideation abilities.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Interdisciplinary Insight Prompting, where prompts are constructed to draw explicit connections between different fields. This involves: (1) Cross-Domain Identification - The model generates initial prompts identifying core concepts from different fields and prompts with, 'How could renewable energy technologies innovate within urban planning frameworks?' (2) Intersection Exploration - Generate follow-up prompts that delve into the intersections, prompting with, 'What unique challenges or benefits arise when combining renewable energy and urban planning?' (3) Synthesis of Ideas - Finally, generate comprehensive prompts asking for novel solutions generated from these insights, e.g., 'What innovative products or processes could arise from the interplay of these fields?'",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate outputs generated through interdisciplinary insight prompts against standard singular domain prompts in creativity benchmarks such as 'The Ideation Challenge Dataset' (1,000 innovative idea submissions). Sample test cases such as 'Combine principles from biology and software engineering to address urban waste management' will be analyzed, and expected responses will indicate novel interdisciplinary approaches. Use metrics for novelty, feasibility, and user satisfaction assessed via automated creativity scoring tools to streamline the evaluation process."

            "Dynamic Collaboration Prompting": {
                "Problem": "Current LLMs struggle to incorporate diverse perspectives effectively when generating research ideas due to their tendency to rely heavily on prior training data, limiting the innovative scope of outputs.",
                "Existing Methods": "Most existing methods utilize single-agent prompting or fixed-role playing where LLMs generate responses based on either direct prompts or pre-assigned roles in multi-agent setups, often leading to repetitive or less novel recommendations.",
                "Motivation": "Dynamic collaboration prompting harnesses the idea of fluid expertise sharing akin to interdisciplinary collaboration among human researchers. By simulating a more organic and flexible exchange of ideas, we can encourage LLMs to generate more unique and diverse research directions.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose a model-agnostic dynamic collaboration prompting framework that involves multiple LLMs engaging in an iterative dialogue. Each agent is assigned an initial research theme from a curated dataset containing 100 interdisciplinary research themes across fields like biology, physics, and AI. Agents can request insights from others at any point in the dialogue. Examples include prompts such as, 'You are an astrophysicist discussing with a molecular biologist. How could advancements in your fields intersect?' and 'How might a computer scientist approach this medical challenge?' Each iteration allows agents to refine their ideas based on spontaneous contributions from their peers and will involve role switching based on generated ideas to evoke organic discourse.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate the framework using the defined dataset of interdisciplinary research themes. Metrics include diversity of generated ideas measured by cosine similarity between their vector representations in a topic space, novelty assessed using a combination of automatic novelty detection algorithms (e.g., binary classifiers trained on a sample labeled for novelty by experts) and quality ratings from expert reviewers using a structured rubric focusing on coherence and innovation. Each LLM's output will be compared against a control group of fixed-role agents in terms of idea diversity (higher cosine distance indicates more diversity)."
            },
            "Conceptual Reframing Step-Through": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often fail to explore unconventional research ideas because they predominantly follow established thought patterns inherent in their training data.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current benchmarks typically rely on linear prompting methods that encourage exploration through chains of reasoning but do not effectively encourage reframing established concepts in innovative ways.",
                "Motivation": "Rooted in cognitive science, conceptual reframing is a powerful creativity technique where existing knowledge is viewed from different perspectives, allowing for breakthroughs and new connections. By incorporating this into prompting methodologies, we can push LLMs to deviate from conventional pathways.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce a two-step Conceptual Reframing Step-Through process where LLMs first generate potential research ideas related to a given topic from a selected list of 50 established scientific concepts. In the second step, the model will be prompted to reframe these ideas by answering guided questions like, 'What if this research was applied differently?' or 'How might an unexpected discipline approach this topic?' Specific prompts will include examples like, 'If neuroscience applied principles from quantum mechanics, what new insights might we discover?' This iterative reframing encourages the model to explore unconventional angles.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Conduct comparative studies using the curated list of scientific concepts, allowing LLMs to generate ideas using both linear prompts and our reframing method. Metrics for evaluation will include creativity scores, based on qualitative analysis from a panel of subject experts using a scoring rubric, and quantitative assessments using clustering analysis to detect novelty through machine learning classification on the generated ideas database."
            },
            "Hybrid Divergence-Disruption Prompting": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often generate similarly themed ideas in scientific literature, resulting in reduced novelty and a lack of significant breakthroughs in research directions.",
                "Existing Methods": "Existing baselines utilize standard prompting techniques that include open-ended queries into established topics or fields, but these often yield a predictable range of research ideas.",
                "Motivation": "In biological systems, diversity through mutation leads to robustness and adaptability. Inspired by this, we can create a paradigm where prompts provoke both divergence by introducing relevant but disruptive elements that challenge the norms of a research area.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose Hybrid Divergence-Disruption prompting, wherein users first identify a research theme from a dataset of 75 common scientific assumptions, then specify a list of three assumptions to challenge while generating ideas. The model will be prompted to generate ideas based on divergence from these norms, followed by a disruptive twist, such as questions like, 'What if the opposite of this common approach is applied? How can combining contradictory theories lead to new findings?' For instance, in drug design, prompting with 'Instead of targeting pathogens, how might we design drugs that adapt to the human microbiome?' will stimulate creative thought.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Evaluate this method against standard open-ended prompts in established research areas, following a structured comparison across three specific themes (e.g., cancer research, renewable energy, and AI ethics). Metrics for novelty and divergence will include expert reviews for ratings on creativity and relevance, in tandem with automatic scoring computations using the Jaccard index to measure distinctiveness on generated idea sets."
            },
            "Rhetorical Questioning Engagement": {
                "Problem": "LLMs often struggle with generating research ideas that address gaps or emerging trends in sciences, primarily relying on pre-existing literature that may not align with current issues or future directions.",
                "Existing Methods": "Current methods use direct questioning techniques but often lead to generic responses lacking engagement with the core implications of the research context.",
                "Motivation": "Rhetorical questioning is a powerful method in academic discourse that stimulates deeper thought and ideation by prompting critical engagement with the topic. This can lead to more profound insights and fresh research avenues.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Rhetorical Questioning Engagement, transforming initial generic prompts through layers of rhetorical questions throughout the dialogue. Starting with a broad query such as, 'What are the implications of AI in healthcare?', the model could include follow-up questions like, 'What does this imply for our understanding of patient care?' and 'Could we be overlooking a key ethical consideration here?' This approach encourages the LLM to engage more deeply with each question while also generating research ideas in response to each query layer.",
                "Experiment Plan": "Test the effectiveness of this engagement by comparing it with baseline generative prompting methods across three research topics selected from a panel of experts. Metrics will include the number of unique research angles generated, diversity of ideas (measured using cosine similarity between outputs), and evaluations on relevance and originality scored by selected subject matter experts using a configured rubric. Outputs will also be analyzed using clustering algorithms to evaluate idea originality."
            },
            "Implicit Conceptual Linking Framework": {
                "Problem": "Current prompting strategies often miss interconnections between disparate research fields, resulting in isolated ideas that fail to leverage the potential for interdisciplinary knowledge generation.",
                "Existing Methods": "Standard multi-task learning approaches require explicit connections between domains, but they do not facilitate organic cross-disciplinary interaction in idea formulation.",
                "Motivation": "Biological systems demonstrate that unexpected connections between different areas can lead to breakthrough innovations. By fostering implicit conceptual linking, we can encourage LLMs to make unexpected associations and generate novel ideas.",
                "Proposed Method": "We propose an Implicit Conceptual Linking Framework, where LLMs are provided with prompts that encourage exploring relations among fields by initiating responses based on unrelated but relevant concepts. For instance, a prompt could state, 'Imagine how theories from theoretical physics could influence developments in neuroscience. What new research questions arise from this link?' The model will explore these interconnections through structured prompts from a collection of 60 unrelated concepts tailored for each interdisciplinary context (like sociology and technology) to aid idea generation.",
                "Experiment Plan": "The framework will be evaluated against traditional prompting approaches, where the effectiveness of outputs will be judged based on originality and potential interdisciplinary applications. Metrics will involve qualitative evaluations by expert reviews using a pre-defined scoring rubric, paired with quantitative measures of divergence and relevance computed through semantic similarity analysis of generated texts."
