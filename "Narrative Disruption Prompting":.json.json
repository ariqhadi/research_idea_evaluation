            "Narrative Disruption Prompting": 
                "Problem": "When tasked with generating narratives or responses to sensitive topics, LLMs can inadvertently perpetuate the biases inherent in their training data, often resulting in harmful and stereotypical portrayals that reinforce societal stereotypes.",
                "Existing Methods": "Most narrative generation methods lack mechanisms for self-correction when biases are detected in generated content. Traditional methods include basic debiasing techniques that either post-process the generated output or minimally modify the training data.",
                "Motivation": "In creative writing, authors often employ disruptive plot twists or surprising character decisions to avoid predictability and enhance narrative depth. This concept can be adapted in prompting LLMs by inserting deliberate disruptions into the storyline, challenging biases and prompting the model to generate nuanced perspectives.",
                "Proposed Method": "We introduce Narrative Disruption Prompting, which uses a structured approach to induce deliberate disruptions by prompting the model with conflicting scenarios or objectives. For example, a prompt could state, \"Imagine your character believes they will become wealthy by exploiting others but unexpectedly meets someone from a marginalized community who challenges their assumptions and biases. How does this encounter change their worldview?\" This approach pushes the model to explore complexity and challenge biased conventions.",
                "Experiment Plan": "The effectiveness of Narrative Disruption Prompting will be assessed using narrative scenarios drawn from the Hateful Memes dataset and evaluated against traditional narrative methods. Metrics will include bias detection scores from BiasFinder, narrative originality ratings through machine-generated uniqueness measures, and the Narrative Quality Assessment automated tool, which will analyze sensitivity and depth of characters' development."
